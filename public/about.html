<h1>About me</h1>

Student by profession,<br/>
Developer with a mission,<br/>
Ideas stay flowing,<br/>
Even without recognition.<br/>

<p>Quiet on the surface,<br/>
But I know what I’m building —<br/>
A vision in motion,<br/>
And belief that's unyielding.<br/> </p>

<p>I don’t talk much,<br/>
Let the work do the speaking,<br/>
One line of code,<br/>
For the future I’m seeking.<br/></p>



<h4>It's not me, this whole is completed by Gpt <br/>
  I just started , it ended</h4>
 <h4>Cut short everthing <br/> 
     I am a student <br/>
     Learning and exploring new things  </h4>
